# About this project<a id="sec-1"></a>

> This is either my love letter to Nix, or Nix's love letter to me, or both.

This project uses [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix) to provision three machines of mine. I may include more eventually.

The main idea of this project is to come into a vanilla OS installation and with only a few steps get a fully provisioned system including

-   all system-level and user-level packages and services
-   all system-level and user-level “dot-file” configurations.

This project can be at least partially useful on any operating system that Nix can be installed on. For example, one of my machines runs NixOS, a full Linux operating system built upon Nix. Another runs MacOS and has the Nix package manager installed within it.

Using Nix and the supporting Nix ecosystem gives us

-   strictly deterministic (reproducible) builds, package installation, and configuration
-   a concise and declarative configuration using community-curated modules
-   easy rollbacks of provisioning
-   easy updates
-   the ability to install multiple versions of software without worry of conflict.

A [provided introduction to Nix](doc/nix-introduction.md) explains motivations to use Nix more.

This repository is designed to be forked and modified. The likelihood that anyone else will want my exact configuration is infinitesimal. Still, you can look at this project to see how the code is laid out. For the most part, it just shows a recommended way to use a few tools to get a reasonably complete provisioning. If you're interested, I've documented [more about my personal configuration](doc/ux.md) in a separate document.

# Community-curated configuration<a id="sec-2"></a>

This project delegates heavily to the following tools:

-   [NixOS's `nixos-rebuild`](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#sec-changing-config), for NixOS system-level provisioning
-   [Nix-Darwin](https://daiderd.com/nix-darwin), for MacOS system-level provisioning with Nix
-   [The Home Manager project for Nix](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager), to provision a home directory in either NixOS or MacOS.

Each project gives us a community-curated catalog of configuration modules that dramatically simplify the code we need. Our configurations can end up extraordinarily concise and declarative. Here's an example:

```text
{
    …
    hardware.pulse.audio.enable = true;
    …
}
```

You can see this configuration concretely in the [./home](./home) and [./machines](./machines) directories.

These configuration modules also provide a battery of checking to make sure settings are valid and congruent.

# Basic operation<a id="sec-3"></a>

The only prerequisite should be the installation of the Nix package manager, after which we can execute the following commands.

> **WARNING:** Don't actually clone this repository and run the commands below. You'd attempt to turn your computer into mine.

On a NixOS machine:

```sh
nix run github:shajra/shajra-provisioning#shajra-nixos-rebuild switch
nix run github:shajra/shajra-provisioning#shajra-home-manager switch
```

On MacOS with Nix installed:

```sh
nix run github:shajra/shajra-provisioning#shajra-darwin-rebuild switch
nix run github:shajra/shajra-provisioning#shajra-home-manager switch
```

Managing the home directory with a separate command from the command for system-level configuration is a design decision to help with system stability. We can experiment more with our user-level configuration without accidentally breaking the whole system. We don't even need to use the system-level provisioning if we don't want to, and we can use Home Manager alone.

After we have Git on the system, we can also clone this repository to any target system for more convenient provisioning.

On a NixOS machine:

```sh
./nixos-rebuild switch
./home-manager switch
```

On MacOS with Nix installed:

```sh
./darwin-rebuild switch
./home-manager switch
```

You can also call each script with a `build` command, which builds out the configuration in `/nix/store` without provisioning and activating it. Instead, it will generate a symlink named "result" in the project root directory pointing back to the build. You can look within it and see that it looks right before switching to it.

Use `--help` with these scripts for more options.

Furthermore, updating supporting software to the latest released versions is as simple as a single command:

```sh
nix flake update
```

And because all of the code needed for provisioning is within this repository, rolling back to a previous version can be as simple as checking out an alternate commit in history, and provisioning from that.

# Understanding this project<a id="sec-4"></a>

Many third-party software and conventions come together to enable all the features of this provisioning project. Hopefully, the code is well-factored and comprehensible, but it's still a lot to look at when coming in fresh.

To help, this project provides some standalone guides to help get started, linked below.

If you don't know much about Nix, consider reading the following provided guides:

-   [Introduction to Nix and motivations to use it](doc/nix-introduction.md)
-   [Nix installation and configuration guide](doc/nix-installation.md)
-   [Nix end user guide](doc/nix-usage-flakes.md)
-   [Introduction to the Nix programming language](doc/nix-language.md)

This project leans heavily on an experimental Nix feature called *flakes*. This project is built on top of another project called [Nix-project](https://github.com/shajra/nix-project), which factors out some helpful code for Nix projects in general. Nix-project doesn't have a lot of code and primarily builds on top of another project called [Flake-parts](https://github.com/hercules-ci/flake-parts). Flake-parts helps make working with flakes a little easier.

Once you're comfortable with Nix and basic usage, the next two guides will help get up to speed with this project:

-   [Nix-project's flakes basic development guide](https://github.com/shajra/nix-project/blob/main/doc/project-developing-basics.md)
-   [Nix-project's flake modules development guide](https://github.com/shajra/nix-project/blob/main/doc/project-developing-modules.md)
-   [A walk-through of this project](doc/provisioning-walkthrough.md)

The development guide introduces Nix flakes and Flake-parts in the context of Nix-project. The guide also covers some patterns for making packages typical in the Nix ecosystem (`callPackage` and *overlays*).

Finally, the walk-through explains how all of these projects and patterns come together in this project to provision my machines.

# Ideas for the future<a id="sec-6"></a>

When provisioning with Nix we try to do everything we possibly can with files built out in `/nix/store` that we then symlink to.

However, there are some limitations to this approach. Fundamental to Nix, `/nix/store` has two fundamental properties:

-   it's read-only
-   it's publicly visible.

The fact that it's read-only provides some impedance when dealing with mutable configuration. Mutable configuration is generally something to avoid, but it's hard to avoid when provisioning machines completely.

Home Manager has a system of activation scripts that are run after provisioning symlinks back to `/nix/store`. These side-effecting scripts enable things like cycling services on/off for a new configuration.

However, we can do more with activation scripts provided we work hard to make sure they are robust and idemopotent. We don't want to abuse this escape hatch, but here are some things that would be possible:

-   We can check out "live repositories" to a specified version. Sometimes, these repositories are designed to maintain a mutable state during runtime. This is the case with Spacemacs and Spacevim, for instance. These projects configure a `.gitignore` file to ignore their respective mutable runtime state.

-   We can manage secrets without worrying about encrypting secrets that might be visible from `/nix/store` or elsewhere. I should be able to transiently pull a secret from a trusted value and prepare it appropriately on the target system. This might involve weaving the secret with a template installed in `/nix/store`. We just have to be careful that the secret stays out of `/nix/store`, only persisting in its target destination.

This last possibility is big for me. Even if modern encryption is highly unlikely to be cracked, keeping encrypted secrets in public spaces is strictly less secure than hiding them behind other barriers. Security is a complicated field, and we shouldn't compromise our expectations merely because our provisioning tools are missing a feature.

I could call another script after the Nix-based provisioning scripts. But this adds more steps. Also, there are benefits to configuring these activation scripts as a declaratively used NixOS-style module.
