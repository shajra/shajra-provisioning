# DESIGN: There used to be a headache of Moneydance relying on JavaFX and JREs
# in Nixpkgs being out of date.  In that time, I patched the JRE provided by the
# Moneydance distribution.  These are the other files in this directory (left
# there in case I need to revert to that technique later).  But now that Nixpkgs
# is on a current-enough JRE, just using that here.
